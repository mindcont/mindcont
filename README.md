<p>我们的愿景是打造一款基于树莓派的智能家居中心。它的特点不在于重复制造轮子，而是集成现有的开源方案，提供一种低成本、透明、实用的整体解决方案。

<p> Our vision is to build a smart home center based on raspberry pie. Its feature is not to repeatedly manufacture wheels, but to integrate existing open source solutions and provide a low-cost, transparent and practical overall solution. </p>
